# Generating a Stylesheet

:::caution Early Feature
Stylesheet generation is still in-progress. Feel free to report bugs [here](https://github.com/dejmedus/sproutcss/issues).
:::

While in development it can be convienient to have access to all the different styling options. However, bringing every SproutCSS style into production would be inefficent.

Instead, we can generate a css file that only contains used styles.

### Create config file

Begin by setting up a sprout.config.js file in the project's root directory. It should contain:

- The <strong>path</strong> to your custom css file, including its name.
- A <strong>files</strong> array, all the file extensions that may contain sprout style classes.

You can also use the command `npx sproutcss --setup` or `npx sproutcss -s` to create one.

```js title="sprout.config.js"
module.exports = {
  options: {
    path: "./sprout.css",
    files: ["html"],
  },
};
```

### Change @import

Remove, or comment out, the SproutCSS path in index.css or other global stylesheet. Instead, import the new custom css file.

```css title="index.css"
/* @import "./node_modules/sproutcss/sprout.css"; */
@import "./sprout.css";
```

:::note Import Path
If config.path is not set to ./sprout.css, make sure to reflect that change when importing i.e. **@import path/to/styles.css**
:::

### Generate stylesheet

Use the command `npx sproutcss`

#### That's all! ðŸŽ‰

You should now have a stylesheet with only the nessecary css classes.

Remember that this stylesheet will be rewritten on each new generation. If you choose to make changes to SproutCSS classes, do so in the <em>node_modules/sproutcss/sprout.css</em> file that npx sproutcss copies classes from.
