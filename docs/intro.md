# Welcome to Sprout

Sprout is an open source collection of component blueprints. 

Develop with the entire SproutCSS stylesheet and when you're ready for Production, generate a custom stylesheet that only includes what you need.

## Getting Started

1. Install the SproutCSS module as a development dependency

``` bash
  npm install --save-dev sproutcss
```
2. Import the stylesheet

``` css title="index.css"
@import "./node_modules/sproutcss/sprout.css";
```

:::note Import Path

**./node_modules** should be replaced with the path to node_modules

:::

3. Copy and paste [components](/docs/usage) as needed.
4. When you're ready, [generate a custom stylesheet](/docs/custom-stylesheet).
